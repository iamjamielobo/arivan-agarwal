                            <p>My academic interests lie in Math and Sciences, particularly Physics. My passion lies in Cricket and Football.  I am a highly passionate and hardworking person. Challenges bring out the best in me. I have been a student who has academically grown and learnt with age, accepting responsibility for my actions, which has led to more diligence towards my academics in high school. I stood among the top 4 in Grade 9 in my batch of 258 students, scored 97.0% in Grade 10 in the final board exams and topped Grade11 as a 1st ranker. I have been consistent with my studies and earned personal accolades in Science (PCB), Mathematics, Social Studies and Hindi. PCM and Computer Science subjects have always excited me because of their broad application in the real world. They have helped me to comprehend and think quickly and efficiently in key decisive situations. These subjects have definitely increased my analytical and logical thinking skills and because of my high interests in them, it has always motivated me to be the best in these respective subjects.</p>

                    <p>I plan to pursue Computer Engineering because the future of the world lies in technology and I have gained some exposure to the field which has given me further insights on the immeasurable possibilities in this field. The idea of being in a field with constant challenges excites me.</p>

                    <p>I have done a few advanced courses from a platform Coding Ninjas like the Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and Data Science and Machine Learning.
                    Data Structures and Algorithms - I studied in depth regarding the programming language Java like Strings, Arrays, Recursion, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Inheritances, trees, OOPS concepts etc. This course established my base foundation in programming and helped me to write codes to solve problems, give insights into them and also check the efficiency of the algorithms. This process in checking the efficiency of the algorithm helped me analyse if the algorithm justly gave the output to qualify the student liable for the loan.
                    Data Science and Machine Learning - I studied basics regarding the programming language in Python and learnt about Functions, OOP concepts, Working with files, numpy, pandas. This furnished my programming skills and helped me to go in depth in the data analysis project where I used the above skills to implement algorithms and also  explore Machine Learning.</p>

                    <p>I used the above knowledge to do a few application-based projects.</p>

                    <p>I further learned some Machine Learning concepts in that field: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Naive Bayes. I did a project in Machine Learning - Optical Character Recognition. This project aims to digitise health records that can be used for archival purposes, health analytics, and better health policies. I got to use textbook algorithms to digitise health records. I learned about computer vision and deep learning algorithms. I learned about existing OCR solutions and their limitations and the modifications needed for the regional context.</p>

                    <p>Through ML Workflow which is  line segmentation and character segmentation, I could identify and isolate the position of each character. Then using Deep Learning Models like CNNs I could classify that character. This machine learning project especially increased my curiosity in this field.</p>

                    <p>Having got some understanding in coding and its application I secured an internship at a start-up company Kuhoo, which is a fin-tech company in student education loan financing business in India. It was my first exposure to the outside professional corporate world. I further learnt relevant segments like python, machine learning, and attended webinars at Kuhoo, where various interns shared their experiences and knowledge. I was fortunate to have good mentors who took the time out to take me through the concepts, applications and processes required which in turn helped me proceed with some confidence and independence in Data Analysis to evaluate the loan eligibility of a student.</p>

                    <p>I learnt and implemented the algorithms which are an integral tool for a fin-tech company when making a decision on loan eligibility of the student. This application in the real world increased my interest in technology and am yearning to learn more through further education and real-world experiences.</p>

                        <div class="content">The challenge sport presents to me is pure adrenaline. I played a lot of sport till grade 9 and then chose to peter it down because of board exams and the pandemic. I have represented the U-14 and U-19 school cricket team. In fact our U-14 team did so well that it went all the way to the semi-final of the Guies Shield tournament. My favourite moments in this match were my century score in batting and the contributions to the team with my bowling, which is something that does not happen often. Despite us losing, this performance of mine helped a lot in the incoming tournaments. In the U-19 cricket team we reached the quarter-final in the Council National Sports at the Regional Level. I have also represented my school in table tennis and reached the 3rd position in the DSO (District Sports Office) championship.</div>

                    <p>Last year when I was at a wedding in my home-town in Jodhpur, I happened to visit some of the villages by sheer chance with an uncle. Being a complete city boy, what I witnessed in the village moved me beyond comprehension. I saw the lack of sanitation and facilities in basic amenities like toilets which made it impossible for people to use it even though they had provision for a toilet. Learn more: <a class="no-bold" href="https://milaap.org/fundraisers/support-arivan-agarwal" target="_blank">Milaap Fundraiser</a></p>

                    <p>I took on the task to research and discover the challenges faced by the villagers to live a life of dignity. My campaign is in the area of Sanitation, which is an important aspect of this basic right. I conducted a small pilot project addressing two issues: 1. Usage by the specially-abled people: Standard Indian style toilet seat is not accessible/convenient for them to sit and 2. providing lighting solutions in public toilets:  Making them usable during the night.</p>

                    <p>After conducting many talks and presentations, I was able to convey my idea to many people in the big cities to come forward to contribute to my cause and was able to collect a total of Rs.3,84,512 through a crowdfunding platform.  I collaborated with an IIT alumni to find a solution for the old and disabled. With the money collected I was able to provide 50 RETROFIT TOILET KITS and 50 LED Lights in small rural area Jodhpur in Rajasthan. I personally went there and documented the work and saw that the people were quite satisfied and happy. I am in touch with a few agencies who can take this project up on a larger scale. I also presented the benefits of improved sanitation in people's lives to a company Aviom Housing. They liked my thoughts and deployed money and resources to set up new toilets in rural parts of Rajasthan.</p>

                    <p>I also partnered with an NGO Masoom and taught underprivileged students Computer Science, English language skills and Mathematics.</p>
                    <p>I collaborated with Hasti Khelti Foundation and taught underprivileged students Computer Science coding languages. Also collected funds of Rs.50,000 to spread education to different parts of the country. (June 2021-August2021)</p>

                    <p>I collaborated with Jay Foundation, Fuel A Dream and Don Ghass and collected funds of Rs. 1,00,000 for the daily meals distribution to the underprivileged. (September-2021) correct dates to include all foundations</p>
